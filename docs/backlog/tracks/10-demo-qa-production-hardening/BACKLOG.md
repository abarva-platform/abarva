# Track 10 — Demo + QA + Production Hardening

_Demo scripts, QA verification suites, persona walks, production readiness hardening._

_Last updated: 2026-04-26 | Wave 21 complete | BLG1_

---

## Purpose
Make the product demoable as one coherent story, not fragmented screens.

## Current state
Apex Retail is rich; Source and Programs were parallel; Experience Gallery exists; production-domain screenshots remain deferred.

## Target state
A 30-minute credible demo that links Apex program, Source event, commercial decisions, evidence, agents, and production caveats.
