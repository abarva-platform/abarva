# Track 03 — Programs Flagship + Workshop Mode

## Purpose
Make the Program experience as rich as Source: journey-aware, workshop-driven, deliverable/evidence-backed, and agent-guided.

## Current state
Apex Retail has rich program seed data; Program flagship exists; Source link and later deliverables/workshop polish remain pending.

## Target state
Programs becomes the reference implementation for Nexus-led transformation execution, not a static project page.

## PROG20 — Program subnav + workflow canvas interaction

**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** pending  
**Type:** feature  
**Primary surface:** Program Detail  
**Primary agent:** Nexus  
**Dependencies:** None

### Purpose
Add/verify Overview, Workshop, Deliverables, Evidence, Actions, Gate, Decisions tabs with deterministic content.

### Primary question answered
How do we move this program to the next gate?

### Workflow and UX requirements
- Must be workflow-oriented, not a generic dashboard.
- Must show known / missing / blocked / next action.
- Must show deterministic vs live caveat where relevant.

### Data contract and caveats
- Seed/demo data today must map to real data tomorrow.
- Do not fabricate evidence.
- If data is missing, disclose missing context and block/downgrade confidence.

### Expected files
- src/components/programs/*
- src/lib/programs/*
- tests

### Forbidden
- No model calls unless explicitly approved.
- No upload/parsing unless explicitly approved.
- No workflow/approval engine unless explicitly approved.
- No broad UI redesign.

### Tests and validation
- Targeted Jest
- Scoped ESLint
- npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false
- npm run build -- --webpack
- git diff --check
- hygiene_gate.sh via CI

### Acceptance criteria
- Page/workflow answers the primary question.
- Agent guidance is contextual.
- No false production/live claims.
- Production readiness tracker is updated or explicitly marked not applicable.

### Codex-ready slice prompt
```text
Implement PROG20 — Program subnav + workflow canvas interaction.

Use Codex Spark Medium by default. Follow PR lifecycle, production-readiness, and design compliance gates from `docs/planning/abarva-master-backlog/BACKLOG_OPERATING_MODEL.md`.

Scope:
Implement the slice described above with the allowed files only. Do not add model calls, upload/parsing, persistence, workflow engine, or unrelated UI.

Final report must include PR link, merge commit, files changed, validation results, production-readiness impact, and exclusions.
