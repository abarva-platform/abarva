# Track 11 — Solution Intelligence + Pattern Library

## Purpose
Expand proprietary pattern/IP depth beyond AMS into Data Platform, IMS, Cloud Ops, Vendor Evaluation, and AI program patterns.

## Current state
Pattern Operating Model, AMS pack, AMS sections, pricing/negotiation standards exist. Data Platform and other packs are pending.

## Target state
AbarVa patterns become structured IP used by Nexus/Sentinel/Atlas/Steward for guidance, artifacts, validation, and decisions.

## PAT1 — Data Platform Managed Services pattern pack

**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** pending  
**Type:** feature  
**Primary surface:** Pattern library  
**Primary agent:** Nexus  
**Dependencies:** None

### Purpose
Author next full pattern pack for data platform managed services.

### Primary question answered
What does a good data platform managed services sourcing event require?

### Workflow and UX requirements
- Must be workflow-oriented, not a generic dashboard.
- Must show known / missing / blocked / next action.
- Must show deterministic vs live caveat where relevant.

### Data contract and caveats
- Seed/demo data today must map to real data tomorrow.
- Do not fabricate evidence.
- If data is missing, disclose missing context and block/downgrade confidence.

### Expected files
- src/** where scoped
- tests under src/__tests__/integration/**
- docs/build/slices/<ID>.md if tracked

### Forbidden
- No model calls unless explicitly approved.
- No upload/parsing unless explicitly approved.
- No workflow/approval engine unless explicitly approved.
- No broad UI redesign.

### Tests and validation
- Targeted Jest
- Scoped ESLint
- npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false
- npm run build -- --webpack
- git diff --check
- hygiene_gate.sh via CI

### Acceptance criteria
- Page/workflow answers the primary question.
- Agent guidance is contextual.
- No false production/live claims.
- Production readiness tracker is updated or explicitly marked not applicable.

### Codex-ready slice prompt
```text
Implement PAT1 — Data Platform Managed Services pattern pack.

Use Codex Spark Medium by default. Follow PR lifecycle, production-readiness, and design compliance gates from `docs/planning/abarva-master-backlog/BACKLOG_OPERATING_MODEL.md`.

Scope:
Implement the slice described above with the allowed files only. Do not add model calls, upload/parsing, persistence, workflow engine, or unrelated UI.

Final report must include PR link, merge commit, files changed, validation results, production-readiness impact, and exclusions.
```
